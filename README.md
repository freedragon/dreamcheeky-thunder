It was decompiled using [Jetbrains Dotpeek](https://www.jetbrains.com/pt-br/decompiler/).

As the dream cheeky website no longer exists, I found the installer via the [Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/).

The link to the Dream Cheeky webpage in the internet archive is [this](https://web.archive.org/web/20130215212448/http://dreamcheeky.com/download-support).
